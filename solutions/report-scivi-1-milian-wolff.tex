\begin{abstract}
In the first project for the scientific visualization class by Eugene Zhang I
got some first hand experience in 3D visualization algorithms, Java programming
and JavaView. While the former was very interesting and gave many opportunities
to play with parameters, models and algorithms, the latter two I could have
done without. Especially the severe lack of up-to-date documentation for the
required beta release of JavaView along with its horrible API made me waste a
lot of time.

\chapter{Euler Characteristics}

The relationship between the euler characteristic $V-E+F$ and the number of
handles turns out to be

\begin{equation}
 V-E+F = 2-2H .
 \label{eq:handle-euler}
\end{equation}

This is in so far intuitive as $2$ is the euler characteristic of a sphere, and
$0$ that of a torus. Now everytime we add another handle, we can say we add a
torus - and hence decrease the euler characteristic by two.

The code for these results can be found in the class \texttt{Ex1\_1}. When
executed, the user can select an \texttt{*.obj} file and the program will
show it's euler characteristic and then iterates over all sibling files and
repeats the procedure.

\section{Sphere}

The sphere has no handles, as can be seen in fig. \ref{fig:sphere}. As such its
euler characteristic is of course $2$.

  \caption{Sphere}
  \label{fig:sphere}
\end{figure}

\section{Torus}

The torus has a single handle and hence an euler characteristic of $0$. See
also fig. \ref{fig:torus}.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{torus.eps}

  \caption{Torus}
  \label{fig:torus}
\end{figure}

\section{Bunny}

The bunny as seen in fig \ref{fig:bunny} has no handles and is thus
topologically equivalent to the sphere with an euler characteristic of $2$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering

  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{bunny.eps}

  \caption{Bunny}
  \label{fig:bunny}
\end{figure}

\section{Hand}

The hand I first suspected to be handle-free. But JavaView calculated an euler
characteristic of $0$, which made me look for a handle. And indeed, there is a
small hole between index and middle finger, which can be seen in fig.
\ref{fig:hand}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering

  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{hand.eps}

  \caption{Hand}
  \label{fig:hand}
\end{figure}

\section{Feline}

The feline has two handles at its tail, which is equivalent to an euler
characteristic of $-2$. See also fig. \ref{fig:feline}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering

  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{feline.eps}

  \caption{Feline}
  \label{fig:feline}
\end{figure}

\section{Dragon}

The dragon's tail creates a handle near its end. As such it has an euler
characteristic of $0$ and is topologically equivalent to a torus. See also fig.
\ref{fig:dragon}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering

  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{dragon.eps}

  \caption{Dragon}
  \label{fig:dragon}
\end{figure}

\section{Buddha}

The buddha has the most handles of the objects provided. Its euler
characteristic is $-10$, and as such we should find six handles in total. Five
of them are easily visible in fig. \ref{fig:buddha1} while the last one should
be seen from the rotated view in fig. \ref{fig:buddha2}.
