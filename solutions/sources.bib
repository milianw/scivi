    abstract = {{Designing tensor fields in the plane and on surfaces is a necessary task in many graphics applications, such as painterly rendering, pen-and-ink sketching of smooth surfaces, and anisotropic remeshing. In this article, we present an interactive design system that allows a user to create a wide variety of symmetric tensor fields over 3D surfaces either from scratch or by modifying a meaningful input tensor field such as the curvature tensor. Our system converts each user specification into a basis tensor field and combines them with the input field to make an initial tensor field. However, such a field often contains unwanted degenerate points which cannot always be eliminated due to topological constraints of the underlying surface. To reduce the artifacts caused by these degenerate points, our system allows the user to move a degenerate point or to cancel a pair of degenerate points that have opposite tensor indices. These operations provide control over the number and location of the
degenerate points in the field. We observe that a tensor field can be locally converted into a vector field so that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of degenerate points in the tensor field and the set of singularities in the vector field. This conversion allows us to effectively perform degenerate point pair cancellation and movement by using similar operations for vector fields. In addition, we adapt the image-based flow visualization technique to tensor fields, therefore allowing interactive display of tensor fields on surfaces. We demonstrate the capabilities of our tensor field design system with painterly rendering, pen-and-ink sketching of surfaces, and anisotropic remeshing.}},
